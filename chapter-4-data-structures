#1  THE SUM OF A RANGE

The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to compute the sum of a range of numbers:

console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.

Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the previous program and see whether it does indeed return 55.

As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional third argument that indicates the “step” value used to build up the array. If no step is given, the array elements go up by increments of one, corresponding to the old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure it also works with negative step values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].

Solution #1
function range(start, end, step) {
  var arr = [];
  if (start < end) {
    for (var i = start; i <= end; i += step) {
      arr.push(i);
    }
      return arr;
  }
  else {
    for (var j = start; j >= end; j--) {
      arr.push(j);
    }
    return arr;
  }
}

function sum(arr) {
  var total = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    total += arr[i];
  }
  return total;
}

#2:  REVERSING AN ARRAY
Arrays have a method reverse, which changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace. The first, reverseArray, takes an array as argument and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The second, reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: it modifies the array given as argument in order to reverse its elements. Neither may use the standard reverse method.

Solution #1
function reverse(arr) {
  var newArr = [];
  for (var i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    newArr[i] = arr.shift(i);
  }
  return newArr;
}

#3:  A LIST
Write a function arrayToList that builds up a data structure like the previous one when given [1, 2, 3] as argument, and write a listToArray function that produces an array from a list. Also write the helper functions prepend, which takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns the element at the given position in the list, or undefined when there is no such element.

If you haven’t already, also write a recursive version of nth.

Solution #1
function arrayToList(arr) {
  var list = null;
  for (var i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    list = {value: arr[i], rest: list};
  }
  return list;
}

function listToArray
