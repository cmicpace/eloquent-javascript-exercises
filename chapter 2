#1:  LOOPING A TRIANGLE
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######

Option #1
var hash = "";
for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
  console.log(hash += "#");
}

Option #2
for (var i = "#"; i.length <= 7; i += "#") {
  console.log(i);
}

#2:  FIZZBUZZ
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

Option #1
for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (
